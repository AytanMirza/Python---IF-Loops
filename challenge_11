# Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100. Try to make your program as efficient as possible using only the tools we learned so far.
# For example, for each number we test for primeness, we only need to check if it’s divisible by smaller primes
# (so we don’t need to test division by 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, ... ).
